# RGPV Alerts Scraper 

**Language**: PHP

**Database**: MYSQL

**Server**: Apache

**Operating System**: Linux or Windows

**3rd party Library**: Simple HTML DOM Parser



**Description**: I never really liked the RGPV  deliver the notifications. Most of the time they don't send any notifications and even if they send something, they do it by sending an SMS on the registered number which we can't update after our initial registration. So if for any reason you changed your number after your initial registration you will not receive the SMS and you can't do anything about it.
As of now, the only reliable way of keeping track of RGPV activity is to visit their website manually.
